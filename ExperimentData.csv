Luyi Feng,1,2017,"Despite the importance of conducting systematic literature reviews (SLRs) for identifying the research gaps in software engineering (SE) research, SLRs are a complex, multi-stage, and time-consuming process if performed manually. Conducting an SLR in line with the guidelines and practice in the SE domain requires considerable effort and expertise. The objective of this SLR is to identify and classify text-mining techniques and tools that can help facilitate SLR activities. This study also investigates the adoption of text-mining (TM) techniques to support SLR in the SE domain. We performed a mixed search strategy to identify relevant studies published from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2016. We shortlisted 32 papers into the final set of relevant studies published in the SE, medicine and social science disciplines. The majority of the text-mining techniques attempted to support the study selection stage. Only 12 out of the 14 studies in the SE domain applied text-mining techniques, focusing primarily on facilitating the search and study selection stages. By learning from the experience of applying TM techniques in clinical medicine and social science fields, we believe that SE researchers can adopt appropriate SLR automation strategies for use in the SE field."
Omara,2,2015,"The large and growing number of published studies, and their increasing rate of publication, makes the task of identifying relevant studies in an unbiased way for inclusion in systematic reviews both complex and time consuming. Text mining has been offered as a potential solution: through automating some of the screening process, reviewer time can be saved. The evidence base around the use of text mining for screening has not yet been pulled together systematically; this systematic review fills that research gap. Focusing mainly on non-technical issues, the review aims to increase awareness of the potential of these technologies and promote further collaborative research between the computer science and systematic review communities."
SR Jonnalagadda,3,2015,"Background: Automation of the parts of systematic review process, specifically the data extraction step, may be an important strategy to reduce the time necessary to complete a systematic review. However, the state of the science of automatically extracting data elements from full texts has not been well described. This paper performs a systematic review of published and unpublished methods to automate data extraction for systematic reviews.
Methods :We systematically searched PubMed, IEEEXplore, and ACM Digital Library to identify potentially relevant articles. We included reports that met the following criteria: 1) methods or results section described what entities were or need to be extracted, and 2) at least one entity was automatically extracted with evaluation results that were presented for that entity. We also reviewed the citations from included reports.
Results :Out of a total of 1190 unique citations that met our search criteria, we found 26 published reports describing automatic extraction of at least one of more than 52 potential data elements used in systematic reviews. For 25 (48 %) of the data elements used in systematic reviews, there were attempts from various researchers to extract information automatically from the publication text. Out of these, 14 (27 %) data elements were completely extracted, but the highest number of data elements extracted automatically by a single study was 7. Most of the data elements were extracted with F-scores (a mean of sensitivity and positive predictive value) of over 70 %.
Conclusions :We found no unified information extraction framework tailored to the systematic review process, and published reports focused on a limited (1 to 7) number of data elements. Biomedical natural language processing techniques have not been fully utilized to fully or even partially automate the data extraction step of systematic reviews."
Al-Zubidy,4,2015,"Context :The number of published systematic literature reviews (SLRs) in software engineering venues is increasing. However, even with their high adaptation rate, the task of performing an SLR requires a large amount of effort and presents a number of barriers. Specifically, during the SLR search phase authors must expend a lot of time and overcome a large number of barriers.
Objective:To help alleviate some of the barriers in the search phase, we identify and prioritize SLR search tool requirements based on input from the SLR community. These requirements will help tool builders ensure they focus their efforts appropriately.
Method :We conducted an SLR and a survey of SLR authors in software engineering. In the SLR we extracted problems and solutions SLR authors reported during their search processes. In the survey we asked respondents to describe the problems they faced during SLR search and to specify any requirements they would like to see as part of an SLR search tool. We also asked survey respondents to describe any tools they use to support SLR search, along with the strengths and limitations of those tools.
Results :Based on analysis of 84 studies from the literature and a qualitative analysis of 131 responses from researchers, we identified a set of functional requirements that authors, researchers, and tool builders can use as a reference. We also describe the tools currently used by SLR researchers.
Conclusions :The list of SLR search tool requirements can be used by tool builders as a guide when constructing new tools. Our analysis of tools showed that more recent tools are covering more of the requirements than in the past."
Al-Zubidy,5,2018,"Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs)
have become an established methodology in software engineering
(SE) research however they can be very time consuming and
error prone. Aim: The aims of this study are to identify and
classify tools that can help to automate part or all of the SLR
process within the SE domain. Method: A mapping study was
performed using an automated search strategy plus snowballing
to locate relevant papers. A set of known papers was used to
validate the search string. Results: 14 papers were accepted into
the final set. Eight presented text mining tools and six discussed
the use of visualisation techniques. The stage most commonly
targeted was study selection. Only two papers reported an
independent evaluation of the tool presented. The majority were
evaluated through small experiments and examples of their use.
Conclusions: A variety of tools are available to support the SLR
process although many are in the early stages of development and
usage. "
Felizardo,6,2015,"A systematic literature review (SLR) is a methodology used to find and aggregate all relevant existing evidence about a specific research question of interest. Important decisions need to be made at several points in the review process, relating to search of the literature, selection of relevantÂ primary studies and use of methods of synthesis. Visualization can support tasks that involve large collections of data, such as the studies collected, evaluated and summarized in an SLR. The objective of this paper is to present the results of a systematic mapping study (SM) conducted to collect and evaluate evidence on the use of a specific visualization technique, visual data mining (VDM), to support the SLR process. We reviewed 20 papers and our results indicate a scarcity of research on the use of VDM to help with conducting SLRs in the software engineering domain. However, most of the studies (16 of the 20 studies included in our mapping) have been conducted in the field of medicine and they revealed that the activities of data extraction and data synthesis, related to conducting the review phase of an SLR process, have more VDM support than other activities. In contrast, according to our SM, previous studies using VDM techniques with SLRs have not employed such techniques during the SLR s planning and reporting phases"
Tsafnat,7,2014,"Systematic reviews, a cornerstone of evidence-based medicine, are not produced quickly enough to support clinical practice. The cost of production, availability of the requisite expertise and timeliness are often quoted as major contributors for the delay. This detailed survey of the state of the art of information systems designed to support or automate individual tasks in the systematic review, and in particular systematic reviews of randomized controlled clinical trials, reveals trends that see the convergence of several parallel research projects.

We surveyed literature describing informatics systems that support or automate the processes of systematic review or each of the tasks of the systematic review. Several projects focus on automating, simplifying and/or streamlining specific tasks of the systematic review. Some tasks are already fully automated while others are still largely manual. In this review, we describe each task and the effect that its automation would have on the entire systematic review process, summarize the existing information system support for each task, and highlight where further research is needed for realizing automation for the task. Integration of the systems that automate systematic review tasks may lead to a revised systematic review workflow. We envisage the optimized workflow will lead to system in which each systematic review is described as a computer program that automatically retrieves relevant trials, appraises them, extracts and synthesizes data, evaluates the risk of bias, performs meta-analysis calculations, and produces a report in real time."
Marshal,8,2018,"Context: Previously, the authors had developed and evaluated a framework to evaluate systematic review (SR) lifecycle tools. Goal: The goal of this study was to use the experiences of researchers in other domains to further evaluate and refine the evaluation framework. Method: We investigate the opinions of researchers with experience of systematic reviews in the healthcare and social sciences domains. We used semi-structured interviews to elicit their experiences of systematic reviews and SR support tools. Results: Study participants found broadly the same problems as software engineering (SE) researchers with the SR process. They agreed with the tool features we had included in our evaluation framework. Furthermore although there were some differences the majority of the importance assessments were very close. Conclusions: In the context of SRs, experiences of researchers in other domains can be useful to software engineering researchers. The evaluation framework for SR lifecycle tools appeared quite robust."

",9,2016,"Background: Since the introduction of the systematic review process to Software Engineering in 2004, researchers have investigated a number of ways to mitigate the amount of effort and time taken to filter through large volumes of literature.

Aim: This study aims to provide a critical analysis of text mining techniques used to support the citation screening stage of the systematic review process.

Method: We critically re-reviewed papers included in a previous systematic review which addressed the use of text mining methods to support the screening of papers for inclusion in a review. The previous review did not provide a detailed analysis of the text mining methods used. We focus on the availability in the papers of information about the text mining methods employed, including the description and explanation of the methods, parameter settings, assessment of the appropriateness of their application given the size and dimensionality of the data used, performance on training, testing and validation data sets, and further information that may support the reproducibility of the included studies.

Results: Support Vector Machines (SVM), NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) and Committee of classifiers (Ensemble) are the most used classification algorithms. In all of the studies, features were represented with Bag-of-Words (BOW) using both binary features (28%) and term frequency (66%). Five studies experimented with n-grams with n between 2 and 4, but mostly the unigram was used. ?2, information gain and tf-idf were the most commonly used feature selection techniques. Feature extraction was rarely used although LDA and topic modelling were used. Recall, precision, F and AUC were the most used metrics and cross validation was also well used. More than half of the studies used a corpus size of below 1,000 documents for their experiments while corpus size for around 80% of the studies was 3,000 or fewer documents. The major common ground we found for comparing performance assessment based on independent replication of studies was the use of the same dataset but a sound performance comparison could not be established because the studies had little else in common. In most of the studies, insufficient information was reported to enable independent replication. The studies analysed generally did not include any discussion of the statistical appropriateness of the text mining method that they applied. In the case of applications of SVM, none of the studies report the number of support vectors that they found to indicate the complexity of the prediction engine that they use, making it impossible to judge the extent to which over-fitting might account for the good performance results.

Conclusions: There is yet to be concrete evidence about the effectiveness of text mining algorithms regarding their use in the automation of citation screening in systematic reviews. The studies indicate that options are still being explored, but there is a need for better reporting as well as more explicit process details and access to datasets to facilitate study replication for evidence strengthening. In general, the reader often gets the impression that text mining algorithms were applied as magic tools in the reviewed papers, relying on default settings or default optimization of available machine learning toolboxes without an in-depth understanding of the statistical validity and appropriateness of such tools for text mining purposes."
Thomas,10,2014,"Systematic reviews are a widely accepted research method. However, it is increasingly difficult to conduct them to fit with policy and practice timescales, particularly in areas which do not have well indexed, comprehensive bibliographic databases. Text mining technologies offer one possible way forward in reducing the amount of time systematic reviews take to conduct. They can facilitate the identification of relevant literature, its rapid description or categorization, and its summarization.

In this paper, we describe the application of four text mining technologies, namely, automatic term recognition, document clustering, classification and summarization, which support the identification of relevant studies in systematic reviews. The contributions of text mining technologies to improve reviewing efficiency are considered and their strengths and weaknesses explored.

We conclude that these technologies do have the potential to assist at various stages of the review process. However, they are relatively unknown in the systematic reviewing community, and substantial evaluation and methods development are required before their possible impact can be fully assessed.

Kitchenham and P. Brereton,11,2013,"Context
Many researchers adopting systematic reviews (SRs) have also published papers discussing problems with the SR methodology and suggestions for improving it. Since guidelines for SRs in software engineering (SE) were last updated in 2007, we believe it is time to investigate whether the guidelines need to be amended in the light of recent research.

Objective
To identify, evaluate and synthesize research published by software engineering researchers concerning their experiences of performing SRs and their proposals for improving the SR process.

Method
We undertook a systematic review of papers reporting experiences of undertaking SRs and/or discussing techniques that could be used to improve the SR process. Studies were classified with respect to the stage in the SR process they addressed, whether they related to education or problems faced by novices and whether they proposed the use of textual analysis tools.

Results
We identified 68 papers reporting 63 unique studies published in SE conferences and journals between 2005 and mid-2012. The most common criticisms of SRs were that they take a long time, that SE digital libraries are not appropriate for broad literature searches and that assessing the quality of empirical studies of different types is difficult.

Conclusion
We recommend removing advice to use structured questions to construct search strings and including advice to use a quasi-gold standard based on a limited manual search to assist the construction of search stings and evaluation of the search process. Textual analysis tools are likely to be useful for inclusion/exclusion decisions and search string construction but require more stringent evaluation. SE researchers would benefit from tools to manage the SR process but existing tools need independent validation. Quality assessment of studies using a variety of empirical methods remains a major problem."
a,100,2019,"Humans have always attempted to correspond with objects in a natural language. Communications have been the essential feature of human life, a powerful tool for sharing and building the information that is passed from generation to generation. Among speech processing problems, automatic speech recognition mechanisms of converting the recorded speech signals into the text are one of the most challenging tasks. The signals are typically processed in a digital representation, so speech processing can be observed as a particular case of digital signal processing. The overall performance of an automatic speech recognition system greatly depends upon the acoustic modeling. Hence, building a precise and robust acoustic model holds the key to a suitable recognition performance. People have used different methods for automated speech recognition system. For recognizing the speech people always choose the English language in the majority of the research and implementation but very less work is done in other languages. Our analysis presents the study of the different speech recognition systems present in Indian and foreign languages in the systematic review of speech recognition paper. This paper gives the review of different aspects related to Automatic Speech recognition. We have elaborated the recent advancement in the speech recognition system, robust method for the development of an automatic speech recognition system and application of automatic speech recognition system in different fields."
b,101,2018,"The incorporation of Information and Communication Technology has changed the landscape of K-12 education, contributing to immense improvement and increased expectations within the sector. Following the introduction of virtual learning environments for use by higher education institutions and the resulting refinement in their design and application, virtual schools are now being applied to K-12 education and have become one of the most transformational trends in such education. This paper reviews the literature to provide insight into the critical distinctions between the terms and definitions used for various aspects of virtual school. In conducting this review, a distinct lack of framework on the critical factors necessary for success as regards the implementation of virtual schools was found in the current literature. To overcome this lack, this paper presents a conceptual framework derived from an in-depth review of related literature. The result of the systematic review revealed 15 factors which have been categorized under five dimensions; namely, technology (system quality, system interactivity, ease of use and usefulness), student's characteristics (self-efficacy and attitude), instructor's characteristics (control of technology, attitude and teaching style), course and content (content quality, diversity of assessment methods and course flexibility) and institutional support (technical support, user training and top management support). This conceptual framework offers the main frame of reference and potential lines of investigation that could be used by educational institutions that seek to implement and develop projects which incorporate eLearning as a main component."
c,102,2020,"General Systems Theory (GST), as it was introduced by Karl Ludwig von Bertalannfy, had a significant, yet mostly unacknowledged influence on systems theory. The purpose of the current review is to highlight and assess the application of the aforementioned theory in the healthcare field and suggest a new approach to the public hearing healthcare sector. A systematic literature review has been conducted in the electronic databases of ScienceDirect, Pubmed and IEEEXplore covering the years of 2009-2019, following the PRISMA guidelines. The article selection was performed to identify GST-related frameworks in the healthcare field and was completed through a process of removing duplicates and non-available articles, analyzing the tittle and abstract, and then reviewing the full text of each selected article. In the final analysis, 47 studies were selected and were thoroughly analysed. Almost half of these articles showed a practical implementation of GST-inspired frameworks, following different types of research methodology. Analysis of these methodologies identified the limitations and positive effects of GST in the healthcare field. Although there is a significant number of references in GST in the healthcare field over the last 10 years, applications of it need to be further tested and explored before they are put into real-situation testing. Simulation models and evidence-based approaches on a micro-, meso- and macro-level of systems should be used to provide the contextual information needed for establishing GST as a driving force in the healthcare field. To this context, a paradigm of GST data framework applied to the hearing loss screening area is hereby presented and discussed. It is shown that a GST approach can be used to identify equilibria in all levels, to balance gain and prediction capacity over time and enhance public hearing health approaches for treatment and management strategies."
d,103,2017,"Different social and psychological variables has been identified in previous studies leading to understand the tourist's behavior and intentions to visit a destination. However, tourism literature does not have a combined list of these constructs for predicting such intentions. Understanding these constructs can provide guidelines for tourism's stakeholders to attract tourists to a specific destination. This review identifies the variables that provoke the intentions of tourists to visit a destination. A systematic literature review methodology has been adopted, focusing on conference papers published during the last six year on tourism research. The study uncovered six essential constructs, namely: Satisfaction, Destination Attractions, Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC), Perceived Risk, Perceived Value, and Experience. A metamodel has been designed revealing the relationship among the aforementioned constructs. Moreover, the findings show that tourist's satisfaction, experience and destination attractions creates positive intentions to visit a destination or recommend it to others."
a,104,2017,"A systematic review about a particular subject provides the basis of knowledge for supporting a research. The increase of scientific information available and the easy access to such information in electronic databases have contributed to the rise of systematic review studies. However, one of the problems that arise with traditional research methods is the difficulty of reading all available articles. Thus, some items must be selected according to predefined selection rules. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of a systematic review is directly related to the relevance of the scientific papers selected according to the purpose of the particular study, among others factors. Therefore, there are several indicators that can be used to prioritize the articles that will set the articles portfolio of the review. The objective of this article is to introduce a method and a web system, implemented in R package, designed to apply automated filters to help in the selection of articles for systematic reviews. We propose two filters in the discussed method: the journal impact factor and the number of citations of the articles. The latter was analyzed by using Pareto rule. In the portfolio creation process, articles are first selected from a query performed in the electronic databases Scopus and Web of Science. Then, the proposed method can be automatically applied using the web system introduced here."

c,106,2019,"Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are expected to bring considerable benefits to society, such as traffic optimization and accidents reduction. They rely heavily on advances in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches and techniques. However, while some researchers in this field believe AI is the core element to enhance safety, others believe AI imposes new challenges to assure the safety of these new AI-based systems and applications. In this non-convergent context, this paper presents a systematic literature review to paint a clear picture of the state of the art of the literature in AI on AV safety. Based on an initial sample of 4870 retrieved papers, 59 studies were selected as the result of the selection criteria detailed in the paper. The shortlisted studies were then mapped into six categories to answer the proposed research questions. An AV system model was proposed and applied to orient the discussions about the SLR findings. As a main result, we have reinforced our preliminary observation about the necessity of considering a serious safety agenda for the future studies on AI-based AV systems."

The development of information technology encourages the development of techniques and methodologies used in project management. This study aims to provide a detailed insight into the trends of project management with systematic literature review and has a particular focus on the project management platform. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the features, technology and architecture of the project management platform. Meta-analysis is needed to determine the optimal layer of project management platform architecture with principal component analysis techniques. Trends in the project management platform literature were analyzed from 2000 to 2018. The findings from the analysis highlighted some of the generic features that project management platforms should have such as schedule/monitoring management, process management, configuration/user management, document management, financial/cost management and resources management. By doing principal component analysis, the number of optimal layers in the project management platform is obtained four: application layer, service layer, data integration layer and management layer."

c,109,2019,"Diabetes Mellitus is a syndrome that occurs due to insulin deficiency but there is no absolute cure for diabetes. There are larger effects of long term diabetes on human body such as eyes as cataracts, kidney failures, nerve damaging, ulcers in feet and gangrene. Hence there is need to understand that, this disease can be prevented through normal physiological process for avoiding greater damage. Thermography is identified as a potential tool to predict and detect the disease progression in an earlier stage in automated way. Actually this type of imaging maps the superficial temperature from the human body and able to identify the disease complications accurately. This paper discusses the recent literature studies with different intervention and comparison of appropriate methods used in detection of diabetes mellitus accurately. The intervention features of different works have been carried out with suitable analysis in identifying the issues and problems associated in medical diagnosis of Diabetic foot neuropathy. This work summarizes the use of thermography in diagnosis process and defines the scope for further improvement in the related research work."
d,110,2018,"Nowadays, with the demand of web applications there is also an increase in the number of problems and crimes that demand an investigation that requires digital forensics techniques in order to manage web evidence. Although there are several studies that address cyber forensics, they are mainly oriented to manage evidence at server side, as far as we know, no systematic literature reviews have been reported on how cyber forensics is addressed at clients' side; considering the internationals standards. Thus, this paper presents a literature review about how cyber forensics is addressed at clients' side related to techniques of identification, collection, analysis, preservation and report of digital evidence. Also, a review of how standards are being used in cyber forensics focused on the client side. The aim of this study is to provide a background of relevant activities that are considered by investigators to handle potentially digital evidence from web environments, considering what internationals standards are solving for this purpose.

b,112,2020,"Android malware has been in an increasing trend in recent years due to the pervasiveness of Android operating system. Android malware is installed and run on the smartphones without explicitly prompting the users or without the user's permission, and it poses great threats to users such as the leakage of personal information and advanced fraud. To address these threats, various techniques are proposed by researchers and practitioners. Static analysis is one of these techniques, which is widely applied to Android malware detection and can detect malware quickly and prohibit malware before installation. To provide a clarified overview of the latest work in Android malware detection using static analysis, we perform a systematic literature review by identifying 98 studies from January 2014 to March 2020. Based on the features of applications, we first divide static analysis in Android malware detection into four categories, which include Android characteristic-based method, opcode-based method, program graph-based method, and symbolic execution-based method. Then we assess the malware detection capability of static analysis, and we compare the performance of different models in Android malware detection by analyzing the results of empirical evidence. Finally, it is concluded that static analysis is effective to detect Android malware. Moreover, there is a preliminary result that neural network model outperforms the non-neural network model in Android malware detection. However, static analysis still faces many challenges. Thus, it is necessary to derive some novel techniques for improving Android malware detection based on the current research community. Moreover, it is essential to establish a unified platform that is used to evaluate the performance of a series of techniques in Android malware detection fairly."
c,113,2019,"INTRODUCTION: The Physics of Notations (PoN) is a theory for the design of cognitively effective visual notations, emphasizing the need for design grounded in objective and verifiable rationale. Although increasingly applied, no systematic analysis of PoN applications has yet been performed to assess the theory's efficacy in practice. OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to assess the scope and verifiability of PoN applications. METHOD: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) of peer-reviewed PoN applications. We analyzed what visual notations have been evaluated and designed using the PoN, for what reasons, to what degree applications consider requirements of their notation's users, and how verifiable these applications are. RESULTS: Seventy PoN applications were analyzed. We found major differences between applications evaluating existing notations and applications designing new notations. Particularly, in the case of new notations, we found that most applications adopted the PoN with little critical thought towards it, rarely considered its suitability for a particular context, and typically treated and discussed the PoN with few, if any, verifiable details and data. CONCLUSION: The results warrant consideration for those applying the PoN to do so carefully, and show the need for additional means to guide designers in systematically applying the PoN."

This review is primarily based on the most frequently used innovation approaches, especially frugal innovation, jugaad, disruptive innovation, Gandhian innovation, catalytic innovation, indigenous innovation, bricolage, blowback innovation, trickle-up innovation, resource-constrained innovation, and BOP innovation. Our analysis finds growing standardization in terminology usage and increasing emphasis on  Ã bottom-up and structured innovation approaches. De-emphasizing the role of technology transfers and spillovers from the West, the findings exhibit increasing applications of these innovations beyond emerging markets to wider markets. Our research results also shed light on the evolution of the topic and instigate further research explorations in the direction of analyzing the user adoption of these constraint-based innovations and understanding the influence of new technological advancements, such as the Internet, mobile telecommunications, and Web 2.0 on the innovation process, with a special focus on the service industry."
b,120,2019,"Personality trait recognition has an essential role in the job screening process. The psychologies perform the analysis based on the survey, the handwriting of the participant, or conduct the interview. The process takes a lot of time and money. Consequently, it inspires that researchers develop a tool to help the screening process faster. The current review papers lack an explanation of deep learning algorithms in personality trait recognition. So we perform this study to classify the latest deep learning algorithms in personality trait recognition. Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and MetaAnalyses Method (PRISMA), we collected 25 key papers which are from Scopus, IEEE, Science Direct, Emerald Insight, and ACM. In this paper, we focus on discussing the problems, deep learning methods, and open issue in personality trait recognition. Based on the finding, the primary problem in personality trait recognition is the complexity of the text and audiovisual data. It induces the low performance of personality trait recognition. In detail, the text-based trait recognition has lower accuracy than the visual and audio based methods. Therefore we have a bigger opportunity to improve the performance of text-based personality recognition than audiovisual based. Moreover, the real experiment in audiovisual trait recognition still in the early stages and it can be explored in more detail."
c,121,2018,"The systematic literature review (SLR) presented in this paper analyzes the relationships among dynamic capabilities, strategic foresight and organizational learning. The purpose of the SLR on dynamic capabilities (DC), strategic foresight (SF) and organizational learning (OL) is to advance the academic perspective on dynamic capabilities by analyzing how SF and OL integrate into the DC framework. This advancement is necessary since the pace of changes in an organization's environment is increasing, causing competitive pressure to rise. An organization needs to address such changes by adjusting existing capabilities or acquire new ones and thus strengthen their competitiveness. SF provides information and insights about future developments or changes of an organization's business environment. After which OL integrates the obtained information into the strategic planning process. It is important to include the concepts of SF and OL into the DC framework, because an organization without learning cannot integrate information into the organizational decision-making process. The results of the SLR present a triangle relation ship among DC, SF and OL that can help to operationalize the DC framework. A practical application of dynamic capabilities facilitates the long-term performance and sustainability of an organization."

b,124,2020,"Fraud is a primary source of organization losses, amounting to up to 5% of yearly revenues. Process-based fraud (PBF) is fraud involving a deviation from the standard operating procedure (SOP) of business processes. PBF hinders the achievement of business objectives because business processes operationalize organizational strategies. A systematic content analysis of the literature was conducted on fraud detection metrics in business processes. The current state of fraud detection was surveyed by focusing on PBF metrics while including all relevant conceptual perspectives of PBF detection. The findings indicate that a large body of research has examined detection metrics for possible fraud, but less attention has been paid to PBF. In addition, the currently available PBF detection metrics do not adequately address the needs of different conceptual perspectives on business processes. For example, metrics may be undefined for one or more of the following: components of a business process, business process perspectives, critical information for auditing the business process, and business process presentation layers. This paper addresses these gaps by paying attention to PBF and various conceptual perspectives for a successful PBF detection approach."

c,137,2019,"The distinct abilities of older adults to interact with touchscreen devices have motivated a wide range of contributions in the form of design guidelines, which aim at informing the design for the aging population. However, despite the growing effort by the research community, many challenges still remain in translating these research findings into actionable design guidelines, with reports hinting scant adoption or implementation issues, which ultimately hurt the development of more accessible interactive systems. In this systematic literature review, we look at the research-derived design guidelines that set the foundation for design guideline compilations and standards, analyzing the aforementioned issues from the perspective of experts trying to discover, classify, and evaluate the work on the area of touchscreen design guidelines for older adults. The review analyses 52 research articles resulting in 434 research-derived design guidelines for touchscreen applications. These guidelines are analyzed using a taxonomy that considered the older adults ability evolution and the design aspects that are the target of the recommendations. The results point to the use of different definition of older adults, which go as early as 55+, with the design of displays and interaction styles to accommodate to vision and dexterity declines as the most prominent areas of research. However, proposed guidelines and recommendations were validated in only 15% of articles analyzed. The analysis also revealed that identifying guidelines and characterizing their focus in terms of ability declines and design aspects addressed is a demanding activity and prone to error, given the quality of reporting and details offered in research articles."

a,139,2019,"Regression testing is the essential process of software maintenance and evolution phase of the software development life cycle for assuring the quality and reliability of updated software. Test case prioritization is the technique of regression testing to reduce the time and effort required for regression testing. Search-based algorithms are used to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the method. Among these search-based optimization algorithms, genetic algorithms are becoming more popular among researchers since the last decade. In this paper, we are doing a systematic literature review, i.e., a secondary study of test case prioritization using genetic algorithms. The objective of this review is to examine and classify the current state of use of the genetic algorithm in test case prioritization. In other words, to give a base for the advancement of test case prioritization research using genetic algorithms. With the use of the systematic literature review protocol, we selected the most relevant studies (20 out of 384) from the appropriate repositories by using a set of search keywords, inclusion/exclusion criteria and the quality assessment of studies. The data extraction and synthesis process and the taxonomic classification are used to answer the research questions. We also performed a rigorous analysis of the techniques by comparing them on research methodology, the prioritization method, dataset specification, test suite size, types of genetic algorithms used, performance metrics, and the validation criteria. The whole process took four months for comprehensive analysis and classification of primary studies. We observed that the parameter settings, the type of operators, the probabilistic rate of operators, and fitness function design have a significant impact on the quality of the solutions obtained. This systematic literature review yields that genetic algorithms have great potential in solving test case prioritization problems, and the area is open for further improvements. Future researchers can fill the research gaps by following the suggestions given in the review. From this review, we found that the use of the appropriate approach can make a genetic algorithm based test case prioritization one of the effective methods in regression testing."

b,144,2019,"Nowadays, learning technologies have solved problems of distance, time, and cost in learning. However, another problem with e-learning, which is lack of student motivation, still remains. Some researchers must apply gamification in e-learning with the aim of giving participation and increasing student motivation. Characteristics of different users, the same learning content, and static gamification elements do not increase the expected motivation. To overcome this problem, gamification must be adapted to the characteristics of the learners. This study uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to analyze research components, methods, and framework used in adaptive gamification. The first step is to determine the research question (RQ) and then to search on several kinds of literature published in popular journal databases, namely IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Scopus, Springerlink and ACM from 2011 - 2019. As a result of a review of 25 selected articles, there are four components of adaptive gamification, namely, player/learner profiles, learning style, behavior, and skill/knowledge. Meanwhile, there are eleven types of methods used in adaptive gamification. The most popular method is scoring and Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM).

d,146,2018,"Bad smells are sub-optimal code structures that may represent problems that need attention. We conduct an extensive literature review on a huge body of knowledge from 1990 to 2017. We show that some smells are much more studied in the literature than others and some of them are intrinsically inter-related (which). We give a perspective on how the research has been driven across time (when). In particular, while the interest in duplicated code emerged before the reference publications by Fowler and Beck and by Brown et al., other types of bad smells started to be studied only after these seminal publications, with an increasing trend in the last decade. We analyzed aims, findings, and respective experimental settings and observed that the variability on these elements may be responsible for some apparently contradictory findings on bad smells (what). Moreover, while in general bad smells of different types are studied together, only a small percentage of these studies actually investigate the relations between them (co-studies). In addition, only few relations between some types of bad smells were investigated, while there are other possible relations for further investigation. We also noted that authors have different levels of interest in the subject, some of them publishing sporadically and others continuously (who). We observed that scientific connections are ruled by a large  Ã small world connected graph among researchers and several small disconnected graphs. We also found that the communities studying duplicated code and other types of bad smells are largely separated. Finally, we observed that some venues are more likely to disseminate knowledge on Duplicate Code (which often is listed as a conference topic on its own), while others have a more balanced distribution among other smells (where). Finally, we provide a discussion on future directions for bad smell research."

a,163,2020,"Blockchain, a form of distributed ledger technology has attracted the interests of stakeholders across several sectors including healthcare. Its' potential in the multi-stakeholder operated sector like health has been responsible for several investments, studies, and implementations. Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems traditionally used for the exchange of health information amongst healthcare stakeholders have been criticised for centralising power, failures and attack-points with exchange data custodians. EHRs have struggled in the face of multi-stakeholder and system requirements while adhering to security, privacy, ethical and other regulatory constraints. Blockchain is promising amongst others to address the many EHR challenges, primarily trustless and secure exchange of health information amongst stakeholders. Many blockchain-in-healthcare frameworks have been proposed; some prototyped and/or implemented. This study leveraged the PRISMA framework to systematically search and evaluate the different models proposed; prototyped and/or implemented. The bibliometric and functional distribution of all 143 articles from this study were presented. This study evaluated 61 articles that discussed either prototypes or pilot or implementations.

c,165,2018,"Compressive Sensing (CS) is a new sensing modality, which compresses the signal being acquired at the time of sensing. Signals can have sparse or compressible representation either in original domain or in some transform domain. Relying on the sparsity of the signals, CS allows us to sample the signal at a rate much below the Nyquist sampling rate. Also, the varied reconstruction algorithms of CS can faithfully reconstruct the original signal back from fewer compressive measurements. This fact has stimulated research interest toward the use of CS in several fields, such as magnetic resonance imaging, high-speed video acquisition, and ultrawideband communication. This paper reviews the basic theoretical concepts underlying CS. To bridge the gap between theory and practicality of CS, different CS acquisition strategies and reconstruction approaches are elaborated systematically in this paper. The major application areas where CS is currently being used are reviewed here. This paper also highlights some of the challenges and research directions in this field."

This means that the system should respond correctly in presence of failures, which are quite probable in a distributed, largely independent, system as cloud systems are. Thus, it is important that cloud systems become fault tolerant, ensuring safe recovery from failures. Since failures in clouds may come from several different sources, although a major role comes from communication failures, the techniques that can be applied to assure reliability are also very different. This survey presents a systematic review of solutions to provide fault tolerance in open source clouds. Our goal with this review is to provide to cloud managers a guided approach to choose a solution for a given problem or system."

Recently, feature selection techniques have been employed on software quality prediction problems with different results and no clear indication of which techniques are frequently used.Objective: This study aims to conduct a systematic review of the application of feature selection techniques in software quality prediction and answers eight research questions.Method: The review evaluates 15 papers in 9 journals and 6 conference proceedings from 2007 to 2017 using the standard systematic literature review method.Results: The results obtained from this study reveal that the filter feature selection method was the most commonly used in the studies (60%) and RELIEF was the most employed among this method, and a limited number of studies employed an ensemble method. Several studies used public datasets available in the PROMISE software project repository (60%). Most studies focused on software defect prediction (classification problem) using area under curve (AUC) as a primary evaluation measure, whereas only two studies focused on software maintainability prediction (regression problem) using mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE) as a primary evaluation measure. All selected studies performed k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model accuracy. Individual prediction models were mostly employed and ensemble models appeared only in three studies. Naive Bayes was the most investigated among individual models, whereas Random forest was the most investigated among ensemble models.Conclusion: Feature selection techniques used by selected primary studies have a positive impact on the performance of the prediction models. Further, both ensemble feature selection method and ensemble models have the ability for increasing prediction accuracy over single methods or individual models and have reported improvement in the prediction accuracy; however, the application of these techniques in software quality prediction is still limited."

By increasing the popularity of touchscreen platform as an input method in mobiles phones, touch gesture behaviour is becoming more significantly important in interaction with the phone. Due to increasing demand for safer access in touchscreen mobile phones, old strategies like pins, tokens, or passwords have failed to stay abreast of the challenges. By utilizing touch gesture behaviour biometric techniques, the authentication mechanism will improve and would make it more difficult for a shoulder surfer to replay the password, even if he observes the entire gesture. The purpose of this research is to conduct a systematic literature review SLR for the current state-of-the-art in the field of touch features gesture. The results of this research identified thirteen touch features followed by the previous studies (PSs) to authenticate users. However, based on the schemes followed by the previous studies (PSs) there was not any scheme that extract and use all touch features for mobile user authentication. There are number of areas of future work that could be carried out to advance upon this research and within the area of authentication on mobile devices. Each of the pervious study (PS) extracted only one or more features. The maximum number of features used in S14 year 2014 and S15 year 2015 were seven features. Extracting thirteen touch features and use them for the authentication will be one contribution in future work."

c,177,2020,"The traditional networks are facing difficulties in managing the services offered by cloud computing, big data, and the Internet of Things as the users have become more dependent on their services. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has pulled enthusiasm in the integration process of technologies and function as per the user's requirements for both academia and industry, and it has begun to be embraced in actual framework usage. The emergence of SDN has given another idea to empower the focal programmability of the system. Because of the increasing demand and the scarcity of resources, the load balancing issue needs to be addressed efficiently to manage the incoming traffic and resources and to improve network performance. One of the most critical issues is the role of the controller in SDN to balance the load for having a better Quality of Service (QoS). Though there are few survey articles written on load balancing, there is no detail and systematic review conducted in load balancing in SDN. Hence, this paper extends and reviews the discussion with a taxonomy of current emerging load balancing techniques in SDN systematically by categorizing the techniques as conventional and artificial intelligence-based techniques to improve the service quality. The review also includes the study of metrics and parameters which have been used to measure the performance. This review would allow gaining more information on load balancing approaches in SDN and enables the researchers to fill the current research gaps."

c,192,2020,"Software quality prediction is the process of evaluating the software developed for various metrics like defect prediction, bug localisation, effort estimation etc. To evaluate these metrics a myriad of techniques have been developed in the literature, from manual assessment to application of machine learning and statistical testing. These methodologies, however, had lower accuracy in determining SQPMs due to their inability to model the complex relationships in the training data. With the wide emergence of deep learning, not only has the accuracy of the pre-existing models enhanced, but it has also opened doors for new metrics that could be evaluated and automated. This study performs a systematic literature review of research papers published from January 1990 to January 2019 that used deep learning to evaluate software quality prediction metrics (SQPM). The paper identifies 20 primary studies and 7 categories of application of deep learning in SQPM. Models using deep learning techniques significantly outperform other traditional methodologies in almost all studies. The concept and external threats to the models are limited, however the time taken to train these models is large. The techniques, currently predominantly applied for defect prediction, have shown promising results in other diverse software engineering fields like code search and effort estimation by modeling the source code efficiently. There is, hence, scope for incorporating deep learning further with pragmatic use and diverse application. The need to find scalable solutions, however, still persists."
d,193,2020,"The recent state of the art innovations in technology enables the development of low-cost sensor nodes with processing and communication capabilities. The unique characteristics of these low-cost sensor nodes such as limited resources in terms of processing, memory, battery, and lack of tamper resistance hardware make them susceptible to clone node or node replication attack. The deployment of WSNs in the remote and harsh environment helps the adversary to capture the legitimate node and extract the stored credential information such as ID which can be easily re-programmed and replicated. Thus, the adversary would be able to control the whole network internally and carry out the same functions as that of the legitimate nodes. This is the main motivation of researchers to design enhanced detection protocols for clone attacks. Hence, in this paper, we have presented a systematic literature review of existing clone node detection schemes. We have also provided the theoretical and analytical survey of the existing centralized and distributed schemes for the detection of clone nodes in static WSNs with their drawbacks and challenges."
a,194,2019,"Code cloning refers to the duplication of source code. It is the most common way of reusing source code in software development. If a bug is identified in one segment of code, all the similar segments need to be checked for the same bug. Consequently, this cloning process may lead to bug propagation that significantly affects the maintenance cost. By considering this problem, code clone detection (CCD) appears as an active area of research. Consequently, there is a strong need to investigate the latest techniques, trends, and tools in the domain of CCD. Therefore, in this paper, we comprehensively inspect the latest tools and techniques utilized for the detection of code clones. Particularly, a systematic literature review (SLR) is performed to select and investigate 54 studies pertaining to CCD. Consequently, six categories are defined to incorporate the selected studies as per relevance, i.e., textual approaches (12), lexical approaches (8), tree-based approaches (3), metric-based approaches (7), semantic approaches (7), and hybrid approaches (17). We identified and analyzed 26 CCD tools, i.e., 13 existing and 13 proposed/developed. Moreover, 62 open-source subject systems whose source code is utilized for the CCD are presented. It is concluded that there exist several studies to detect type1, type2, type3, and type4 clones individually. However, there is a need to develop novel approaches with complete tool support in order to detect all four types of clones collectively. Furthermore, it is also required to introduce more approaches to simplify the development of a program dependency graph (PDG) while dealing with the detection of the type4 clones."
b,195,2018,"As we know that number of devices connected through internet are growing rapidly, based on an estimation the number of active internet connections will be seven connections per human by the year 2020. These smart objects connect and communicate with each other and create IoT environment. Integration of such smart objects is not an easy task. Although different challenges and issues are associated with IoT, but due to its great applicability researchers have proposed a number of solutions to overcome any difficulty. One of the major concern in IoT environment is security. Various frameworks and solutions were proposed to get over the security issue. In this research paper, we are performing a systematic review on different security frameworks and the major focus of this research paper is on trust based security framework."
c,196,2017,"Presently, educational institutions compile and store huge volumes of data, such as student enrolment and attendance records, as well as their examination results. Mining such data yields stimulating information that serves its handlers well. Rapid growth in educational data points to the fact that distilling massive amounts of data requires a more sophisticated set of algorithms. This issue led to the emergence of the field of educational data mining (EDM). Traditional data mining algorithms cannot be directly applied to educational problems, as they may have a specific objective and function. This implies that a preprocessing algorithm has to be enforced first and only then some specific data mining methods can be applied to the problems. One such preprocessing algorithm in EDM is clustering. Many studies on EDM have focused on the application of various data mining algorithms to educational attributes. Therefore, this paper provides over three decades long (1983-2016) systematic literature review on clustering algorithm and its applicability and usability in the context of EDM. Future insights are outlined based on the literature reviewed, and avenues for further research are identified."

a,198,2020,"Fusion technologies have rapidly evolved. These technologies are normally customized according to the needs of domains. Despite a large number of publications on intelligence fusion applications for various domains, they are scattered. The aim of this review is to present the state of the art for intelligence fusion applications within a specific domain. We identified three major domains for the purpose, namely robotics, military, and healthcare, during the initial process of the systematic review. These three domains are always in need of superior intelligence. Articles were searched mainly in IEEE Xplore. We limit the range of publications to the year 2014 to 2019, to focus on the most recent publications. We adopt the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol to screen, filter and evaluate qualities of each retrieved article. As a result, we retrieved 675 articles at the initial stage of the search, we conducted screening and filtering process and reviewed 153 articles potential articles, and finally, we excluded 36 articles as they do not comply with our quality assessment criteria. Only 117 articles are included. The results of this study are a list of classified applications within the domains and a number of relevant techniques or approaches used in each classified application. The finding of this review showed that the most published works for the use of intelligence fusion are mainly applications in the robotics domain, where mostly used techniques are Kalman Filter and its variants. Outcomes of this study can be a guideline or an insight for researchers to further develop and implement in this field."
b,199,2020,"Bio-metric frameworks are getting to be progressively important, since they are more reliable and proficient for identity confirmation. One such biometric is gait. The pattern by which an individual walks is mentioned as gait. It's a locomotion that's achieved through the movement of a person's limb. Unlike several approaches gait is a behavioral biometric, that is taken into consideration for user authentication as it shows distinct patterns for every individual. Also, less obtrusion of user has made this biometric method to be more advantageous compared to others. During this survey we tend to concentrate on varied gait approaches, applications and various machine learning techniques which will be used for classification of gait features and its applications."

d,201,2020,"Techniques predicting the type of diseases affecting plants in their lifetime will be of immense help to agriculturists. This article throws light upon such techniques in the form of a survey that had been carried out comprehensively covering various image based plant leaf diseases. Such diseases are mostly grievous and they strike at any part of the plant. There are huge accumulated losses due to such diseases that bring down the productivity and increase the economic losses in the agricultural industry. Agriculture industry needs to sustain and evolve from such obstacles to be highly profitable. This can be done by precisely monitoring the health and detecting the diseases at appropriate stages of the plant's life time. Technology has spread its wings in every field of day to day life but still its reach in the field of agriculture is not up to the mark. Agriculture industry is still thriving on outdated technical methodologies. Improper diagnosis of plant disease may lead to huge losses in terms of production, time, cost and product quality. The condition of the plant needs to be tracked throughout its growing stages leading to successful cultivation. As part of technological innovation, researchers had been applying the image processing techniques for monitoring as well as diagnosing the plant diseases in its various stages. Appropriate machine learning algorithms are being designed and applied for precisely identifying the various infections on plants throughout its life cycle and the type of treatment that can be afforded for overcoming loss."

To ease control over this engineering marvel substantially, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has paved its way in recent years quite remarkably. RL enables robots to become self-aware towards carrying out a specific task followed by user operations. For decades of rigorous endeavor, this research field has gone through numerous groundbreaking developments and it will be the same for the coming days. Therefore, this paper steps in to enlighten the scientific community with a systemic review of the published research papers within the past decade. The bibliographic data that is extracted from the papers are analyzed using an automated tool named Vosviewer with respect to some parameters. Substantial excerpts from the most influential papers are highlighted in this work. Furthermore, this paper points out the global research practice in this field. The paper also generates some intriguing questions and answers them in regards to the research topic.

b,203,2018,"Regression testing aims at testing a system under test (SUT) in the presence of changes. As a SUT changes, the number of test cases increases to handle the modifications, and ultimately, it becomes practically impossible to execute all of them within limited testing budget. Test suite reduction (TSR) approaches are widely used to improve the regression testing costs by selecting representative test suite without compromising effectiveness, such as fault-detection capability, within allowed time budget. The aim of this systematic review is to identify state-of-the-art TSR approaches categories, assess the quality of experiments reported on this subject, and provide a set of guidelines for conducting future experiments in this area of research. After applying a two-facet study selection procedure, we finalized 113 most relevant studies from an initial pool of 4230 papers published in the field of TSR between 1993 and 2016. The TSR approaches are broadly classified into four main categories based on the literature including greedy, clustering, search, and hybrid approaches. It is noted that majority of the experiments in TSR do not follow any specific guidelines for planning, conducting, and reporting the experiments, which may pose validity threats related to their results. Thus, we recommend conducting experiments that are better designed for the future. In this direction, an initial set of recommendations is provided that are useful for performing well-designed experiments in the field of TSR. Furthermore, we provide a number of future research directions based on current trends in this field of research."
c,204,2018,"The general approach of the work described is to develop a Systematic Review to assist health professionals, specifically Physiotherapists, collecting data about interactive environments used to assist in the treatment of injuries from stroke. Although the area is well studied, it is necessary to take into account the lack of studies that mix the development of the environments, as well as the interactivity with the patient. In this work a Systematic Review was conducted in which 13 scientific papers published on virtual and interactive environments were studied until June 2017. The main essence of this study is to provide technologists, physicians and physiotherapists a better and continuous approach to offer the patient, ways in which one does not have to sacrifice oneelf or consider such monotonous procedures."
d,205,2019,"Load forecasting is always required for the planning and extension of power system. With the emergence of smart grid, forecasting of load and its management has been a primal concern for a researcher. Load forecasting has been challenging not only for developing countries but also for developed and industrialized nations. The main problems for developing nations are missing necessary data, appropriate load forecasting models and required institutions, these limitations are somewhat less serious for developed nations. Due to limitations in the model structure and missing data forecasted energy demands are often found to deviate from the actual demands. This paper contains a systematic review on the methods of load forecasting which is done on the basis of 126 research papers and the best methods for load forecasting on the basis of time, inputs, outputs and error type have been determined. The methods compared are time series analysis and machine learning algorithms. This meta-analysis has been defined to help researchers to take an effective decision by choosing the right model from their problem."
a,206,2018,"Educational Robotics (ER) has revealed several benefits in the educational context, not only helping the teaching of disciplines, but also making possible the development of several abilities, such as teamwork, problem-solving, and creativity. Among various robotics kits, LEGO  Robotics has been shown one of the best results considering some evaluated criteria (modularity level, hardware, curriculum, price, etc.). Some studies analyze the teaching practices, some compare technologies, and others evaluate the kits in a pedagogical way. However, it is essential to investigate all these contexts together in order to improve the impact produced by the ER in education and to know the best teaching practices associated with the most powerful technologies. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) environments and programming languages adopted in the LEGO  Robotics context, b) educational practices applied during classes based on LEGO  Robotics, and c) the educational levels in which robotics has been applied with positive results. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out a systematic review of the literature. Our main findings are: a) the most widely used environment and programming language are LabVIEW along with the LEGO 's block-based programming language, b) we identified LEGO  Robotics is used for teaching programming, interdisciplinary contents, participation in tournaments, robotics, and computational thinking, c) LEGO  Robotics is used with success by students of different levels, such as K12, undergraduate, and graduated. Finally, we discuss some problems and limitations related to ER and point out that there is no standardization of teaching practices or methodologies for evaluating results, indicating that more research is needed to find the best scenario regarding technologies, methods, and target audience."

c,208,2017,"This paper presents a systematic review of evidence based studies on attention detection and measurement in virtual reality (VR) based learning intervention for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We carried out a search from three different large databases for articles between January 2008 and May 2017. The objective of this paper is to review learning intervention studies featuring measures of attention as an outcome variable for children with ASD in a virtual reality environment thereby addressing four specific questions: what are the types of attention studied in a virtual reality environment for children with ASD, the attentional behaviors, the technology used in detecting and measuring the attentional behaviors and the synthesis of empirical evidence across the reviewed studies. In the context of (VR) environment, there are five types of attention studied in the reviewed articles where nine attentional behaviors were targeted with six different technologies and strategies. The synthesis of the empirical studies reviewed showed that two out of five types of attention are always targeted for attention evaluation, four out of the nine types of attentional behaviors are commonly studied, two out of the six technologies are mostly used and two out of the six strategies of attention assessment are popularly used. The synthesis outcome of this systematic review can serve as an evidence base for researchers who are interested in attention assessment of children with ASD in a virtual reality environment."

c,216,2019,"To unleash the great potential of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is critical to facilitate the creation and operation of IoT systems across IoT, edge and cloud infrastructures with vast heterogeneity, scalability and dynamicity. What is the current landscape of the existing approaches and tools that attempt to cope with this complexity? The work presented in this paper contributes to this picture. This paper presents the results of our systematic literature review (SLR) on research approaches and tools for the deployment and orchestration of IoT systems (DEPO4IoT). From thousands of relevant publications, we systematically identified and reviewed seventeen (17) primary studies for data extraction and synthesis to answer our predefined research questions. The results of our SLR show the technical details of the primary DEPO4IoT studies. A main finding is that most approaches do not properly support software deployment and orchestration at the tiny IoT device level. Moreover, there is a lack in terms of properly addressing the trustworthiness aspects in approaches for IoT systems deployment and orchestration. In this paper, we suggest some potential research directions to address the gaps found."

a,218,2020,"Cyber-security is the practice of protecting computing systems and networks from digital attacks, which are a rising concern in the Information Age. With the growing pace at which new attacks are developed, conventional signature based attack detection methods are often not enough, and machine learning poses as a potential solution. Adversarial machine learning is a research area that examines both the generation and detection of adversarial examples, which are inputs specially crafted to deceive classifiers, and has been extensively studied specifically in the area of image recognition, where minor modifications are performed on images that cause a classifier to produce incorrect predictions. However, in other fields, such as intrusion and malware detection, the exploration of such methods is still growing. The aim of this survey is to explore works that apply adversarial machine learning concepts to intrusion and malware detection scenarios. We concluded that a wide variety of attacks were tested and proven effective in malware and intrusion detection, although their practicality was not tested in intrusion scenarios. Adversarial defenses were substantially less explored, although their effectiveness was also proven at resisting adversarial attacks. We also concluded that, contrarily to malware scenarios, the variety of datasets in intrusion scenarios is still very small, with the most used dataset being greatly outdated."
b,219,2020,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) may have a transformative influence on transportation systems. AV use is expected to reduce crash, transport costs, and land use. However, the net effects of the autonomous vehicle are unknown because there are no fully-autonomous vehicles in reality. The simulation systems are indispensable to be built up not only for cost but also for obtaining massive data. An agent-based simulation is capable of simulating the entities in a complex system, such as the AV system. Considering the potential of agent-based models to complement existing models and the difficulty to understand, to duplicate and to compare different agent-based models, this paper review existing agent-based modeling of autonomous vehicles with the help of ODD protocol, which has been applied in the review of agent-based land-use change models and agricultural policy evaluation. The significant variables that researchers have taken into consideration in sensitivity analysis and in the different scenarios are explored in the paper. Fleet size is the primary variable researchers considered, and we also discussed the probable causes of different AV replacement rates. We have assessed the quality of reviewed articles to gain more acceptance from the agent-based modeling community. Most of the reviewed papers follow the ODD protocol of agent decision making. However, in order to improve the level of modeling transparency, the executable and related data shall be available, at least the data source and the programming language/simulation platform should be provided. Several recommendations for further research are also presented."
c,220,2018,"Since ERP solution facilitates has changed in business environment and also has helped in supporting managerial level to make decision. Therefore, ERP system is important strategy for organization's survival. One of the critical issues that affect a successful ERP implementation is the implementation method. In previous research, it showed that many organizations had faced complexity when they were implementing ERP in order to meet their requirements. In other cases, the ERP systems are unable to provide solution which is a simplicity of the necessary business processes. The ERP implementation complexity is one of the factors that lead the failures. Thus, here, we intend to propose an agile approach to reduce complexity and eventually our intention is to improve ERP implementing to become more successful. In this study, we are employing a systematic literature review (SLR) approach to identify the principles factors of the agile methods for ERP implementation. In result of employing this SLR method, we found that agile values and principles are correlated in ERP implementation complexity."
d,221,2020,"Machine learning (ML) techniques are changing both the offensive and defensive aspects of cybersecurity. The implications are especially strong for privacy, as ML approaches provide unprecedented opportunities to make use of collected data. Thus, education on cybersecurity and AI is needed. To investigate how AI and cybersecurity should be taught together, we look at previous studies on cybersecurity MOOCs by conducting a systematic literature review. The initial search resulted in 72 items and after screening for only peer-reviewed publications on cybersecurity online courses, 15 studies remained. Three of the studies concerned multiple cybersecurity MOOCs whereas 12 focused on individual courses. The number of published work evaluating specific cybersecurity MOOCs was found to be small compared to all available cybersecurity MOOCs. Analysis of the studies revealed that cybersecurity education is, in almost all cases, organised based on the topic instead of used tools, making it difficult for learners to find focused information on AI applications in cybersecurity. Furthermore, there is a gab in academic literature on how AI applications in cybersecurity should be taught in online courses."
a,222,2019,"Cardiovascular diseases currently pose the highest threat to human health around the world. Proper investigation of the abnormalities in heart sounds is known to provide vital clinical information that can assist in the diagnosis and management of cardiac conditions. However, despite significant advances in the development of algorithms for automated classification and analysis of heart sounds, the validity of different approaches has not been systematically reviewed. This paper provides an in-depth systematic review and critical analysis of all the existing approaches for automatic identification and classification of the heart sounds. All statements on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2009 Checklist were followed and addressed thoroughly to maintain the quality of the accounted systematic review. Out of 1347 research articles available in the academic databases from 1963 to 2018, 117 peer-reviewed articles were found to fall under the search and selection criteria of this paper. Amongst them: 53 articles are focused on segmentation, 72 of the studies are related to the feature extraction approaches and 88 to classification, and 56 reported on the databases and heart sounds acquisition. From this review, it is clear that, although a lot of research has been done in the field of automated analysis, there is still some work to be done to develop robust methods for identification and classification of various events in the cardiac cycle so that this could be effectively used to improve the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases in combination with the wearable mobile technologies."
b,223,2019,"Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) is a simplified method for long-term, continuous, and bedside monitoring of brain activity. While conventional Electroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard of assessing brain function, aEEG is easy to operate and allows bedside interpretation of brain activity by health care providers without extensive knowledge of neurophysiology. aEEG is increasingly applied in neurological monitoring in neonates, especially in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). To a growing extent, researchers and clinicians are convinced that aEEG provides valuable clinical information and can be used to assess the severity of neonatal encephalopathy. Meanwhile, to digitalize the aEEG transformation process and automate the interpretation process, different algorithms have been proposed in the last decades. This paper provides a comprehensive review of aEEG for neonatal monitoring from both clinical and technological perspectives. The paper first reviews the clinical applications of aEEG and discusses the merits and demerits of neonatal aEEG monitoring in terms of the assistance of the treatment and prognosis of cerebral diseases like hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), seizure and so on. And then furthermore, the algorithms to transform EEG into aEEG and the algorithms for aEEG interpretation like the automatic classification of aEEG tracing, automatic seizure detection of aEEG, etc. are reviewed."
c,224,2018,"This Research Full Paper presents a review of the literature related to novices' interest in learning to code. Students' interest in this topic has been mentioned in the Computer Science Education (CSE) field since the 1990s. Although it got the attention of computing faculty and shaped a wide number of proposals, students' disinterest remains a complex struggle in Computer Science (CS) courses. On the other hand, we still have little knowledge about what theoretical concepts and methods of research are adopted by researchers who study interest, particularly among novices in programming. As an attempt to close this gap, we carried out a systematic review process to identify frequent assumptions and methodological decisions aiming to establish a sense of what happened in the last seventeen years in this research field. Based on our review, the findings revealed that although a high number of contributions is propagated, most of them are based on lesson learned reports that fail in producing reliable evidences to substantiate the effectiveness of some proposals. The analysis of the 36 publications considered relevant to our systematic review revealed that there is not a convergent understanding between CSE researchers of what is interest and how to measure. Not many of them study interest based on specific theories or observe how students' interest changes over time. So, although we have found many publications referring to practical and experimental applications, we could see that this research area is still fragmented and led by a bit of uncertainty about what really can sustain novices more interested in learning coding."
d,225,2018,"A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) allows us to combine and analyze data from multiple (published and unpublished) studies. Though it provides a complete and comprehensive empirical evidence of an area of interest, the results we usually get from the data synthesis phase of an SLR include huge tables and graphs and thus, for users, it is a tedious and time-consuming job to get the required results. In this work, we propose to semi-automate some steps which can be used to fetch the information from an SLR, beyond the traditional tables, graphs, and plots. The automation is performed using Semantic Web technologies like ontology, Jena API and SPARQL queries. The Semantic Web, also called Web 3.0, provides a common framework and thus allows us to share and re-use the data across the applications and enterprises. It can be used to integrate, extract, and infer the most relevant data required by the users, which are hidden behind the huge information on the Web. We also provide an easy-to-use user interface in order to allow users to perform different searches and find their required SLR results easily and quickly. Finally, we present the results of a preliminary user study performed to analyze the amount of time users need to extract their required information, both via the SLR tables and our proposal.

A blockchain is an immutable append-only ledger maintained by a peer-to-peer network, where the whole network needs to reach a consensus on the transactional data stored on the ledger. With the decentralization nature, the design of IoT and blockchain aligns with each other well. Blockchain has been integrated with the IoT to solve the existing IoT problems. Our research focuses on analyzing the solutions proposed in academia and the methodologies used to integrate blockchain with the IoT. Through conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on peer-reviewed, published articles on blockchain-based solutions for IoT, we gather the knowledge on current technical approaches implemented to integrate blockchain into the IoT. Majority of the research in this space is either at a conceptual level or at a very early stage. However, we only found 35 published papers with the real implementation of blockchain in the IoT platforms. We elicit the challenges of the IoT that were being addressed, and the detailed design of the blockchain-based solutions from two perspectives, namely data management and thing management. The evaluation methods and metrics used by those works are also being recorded and analyzed. In addition to the analysis of the literature, we provide our insights on improving the existing solutions and research methodology based on our expertise and experience on the blockchain."

a,234,2020,"Due to the lack of living space and the increase in population, there has been a construction boom in the underground space to improve the quality of human life. Tunnel engineering plays a vital role in the development of underground space. In addition to traditional methods, some intelligent methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been applied to various problems in the tunnel domain in recent years. This paper systematically reviews the application of ANNs from different aspects of tunnel engineering. It reveals that the backpropagation algorithm (BPA) and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) are the most widely used. Due to the limitations of some original models, some scholars use optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the original ANNs to obtain better prediction results. A comparison between the ANN-based methods and methods like statistical methods is conducted. Finally, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The recommended ratio of the training set and test set is 3:1; (2) The advantage of optimized ANNs is not apparent when the optimization algorithm varies. Additionally, the performance of ANNs is always better than that of statistical methods."

This systematic review attempts to address eleven specific research questions related to the learing skills, participants, AR technology, research design, data collection methods, settings, evaluation parameters, intervention outcomes, generalization, and maintenance. The social communication skill was the highly targeted skill, and individuals with ASD were part of all the studies. Computer, smartphone, and smartglass are more frequently used technologies. The commonly used research design was pre-test and post-test. Almost all the studies used observation as a data collection method, and classroom environment or controlled research environment were used as a setting of evaluation. Most of the evaluation parameters were human-assisted. The results of the studies show that AR benefited children with ASD in learning skills. The generalization test was conducted in one study only, but the results were not reported. The results of maintenance tests conducted in five studies during a short-term period following the withdrawal of intervention were positive. Although the effect of using AR towards the learning of individuals was positive, given the wide variety of skills targeted in the studies, and the heterogeneity of the participants, a summative conclusion regarding the effectiveness of AR for teaching or learning of skills related to ASD based on the existing literature is not possible. The review also proposes the research taxonomy for ASD. Future research addressing the effectiveness of AR among more participants, different technologies supporting AR for the intervention, generalization, and maintenance of learning skills, and the evaluation in the inslusive classroom environment and other settings is warranted."
